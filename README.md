# Shoutcast Stream Project

## Introduction
I wanted to be able to deliver audio from my home computer running a playlist of tracks and stream it to my website so I could listen to it
from anywhere as long as I had an internet connection from my device (phone/tablet/pc). Furthermore, I wanted the ability to provide live audio
from my mixer source where I have a microphone, and broadcast the stream as a live broadcast.

The plan was to configure my software [Mixxx](https://www.mixxx.org/) so I could cue up tracks, hit play and stream it so I could leave, and listen to the tracks from my phone.

I expanded this plan to allow me to provide a live stream through the use of [Darkice](http://manpages.ubuntu.com/manpages/trusty/man1/darkice.1.html) on a second computer which simply could be as small as a Raspberry Pi machine.

[stream.hawkwynd.com](http://stream.hawkwynd.com) is a demo of this application.



### DJ Software
In my search for Ubuntu compatible software, I found [Mixxx](https://www.mixxx.org/) to be the best with the most robust features and abilities. It is open-source, free and I have found it to have many really helpful functions that save me time and energy in managing my playlists, shows and overall library of tracks.

* [Virtual DJ](https://www.virtualdj.com) has a free download for personal use, commercial use requires a license.
* [Mixxx](https://www.mixxx.org/) - free open-source for many OS's.

Use your own resources to find a software you're comfortable with and compatible with connecting to a shoutcast server.
